## Program Description

My program takes the user's web camera input and runs that input frame by frame through a model that will be trained to detect humans, dogs, and cats. It will count how many of each it saw and display those numbers at the end. If there aren't any categories mentioned in the frame, then the program will show "nothing detected."Â

Q: I get the error "no frame captured" when i run the program

A: make sure nothing is already using your webcam including screen recording software or a previous run, make sure your camera / wires are not damaged or that they are not in a USB hub, connect the cameras directly into your computer as your usb hub may not have enough bandwith to transport the information, make sure only one camera is connected, finally, try running smaller perameters. 

Q: I get the error "no protxtfile found" or "no model files found" or both
A: download the files from the directory here under "Mac_version": https://github.com/RHC-CIT-128-SP23/project-steezystudent
