## Program Description

My program takes the user's web camera input and runs that input frame by frame through a model that will be trained to detect humans, dogs, and cats. It will count how many of each it saw and display those numbers at the end. If there aren't any categories mentioned in the frame, then the program will show "nothing detected."Â
