# CIT 128 Project: Student Directed Project Directions

**Version:** 12/20/2021

## Directions

CIT 128 is a software engineering course focused on the application of software engineering techniques for the design and development of large programs.

In this project, you will take what you have learned about software engineering and decide on an individual Python programming project in consolation with me. You will need to design a program that utilizes the elements learned in this class as well as Python I. This will be a challenge as there will be no demo versions and if you want unit tests, you will need to design them.

As your project is unique, you will be required to help craft your rubric and grading scale as part of the program description. This will be completed as a part of the project drafts.

Note, there are requirements on how often you must commit your work to GitHub and the number of lines of code expected to be a large program. This means you will need to be working on it each week rather than cramming it in at the end.

## Rubric / Grading Scale

There are two parts to the grading rubric, the instructor provided rubric and the student provided rubric. The instructor provided rubric is worth 125 points may not be modified by the student and consists of requirements that all students must achieve regardless of individual project description or goals.

The student provided rubric is worth 75 points and is specific to the individual student directed project description. Students may decide how to divide up the points in consultation with the instructor. Specific goals with point allocations must be given in the rubric to be accepted or the instructor may choose to modify the rubric or points distribution at any time. If no modifications are made to the Student Grading Rubric, no points will be awarded for that section.

* **Instructor Grading Rubric (125pt)**
  * **Update README.md with the following (32 points total)**
    * Update the Student Name, CRN, & Semester / Year. (2pt)
    * Add a description of the program that includes the goals of the program. (5pt)
    * Add a description of the software engineering techniques used for the design & development of this program. (5pt)
    * Provide a link to a video recording demonstrating the working application. (5pt)
    * Write a test script for how to fully test the program including a numbered step by step walk through for manual testing. If unit tests are provided, make sure to include that process in the test script. (5pt)
    * Test script includes information on expected input methods or input values to be used as part of the testing and what values will trigger errors (5pt)
    * Markdown on README.md is properly formatted. (5pt)
  * **Update DIRECTIONS.md with the following (15 points total)**
    * Student grading rubric was updated by the third week of the project start. (5pt)
    * Final student grading rubric grading descriptions are fully explained with points assigned to each point. (5pt)
    * Markdown on DIRECTIONS.md is properly formatted. (5pt)
  * **Programming of the Application (28 points total)**
    * GitHub Commits: Weekly programming commits showing progress from Week 9 - Week 16. (8pt)
    * Write a minimum of 500 - 1000 source lines of code (sloc) as shown in the GitHub repo. Markdown files and third-party libraries or modules do not count towards the line count but may be used. (10pt)
    * Application is [documented using Docstrings](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) appropriately with comments used to flag specific blocks of code. (5pt)
    * Application code is well organized and has appropriate whitespace for readability. (5pt)
  * **Data Structure / Algorithm Use (35 points total)**
    * The majority of the core application code written by the student uses Object-Oriented Programming classes and techniques. (15pt)
    * The main program file uses functional or procedural programming techniques to start the application and instantiate objects from classes. (10pt)
    * At least one data structure or algorithm, as described in zyBooks Modules 6 - 17, is included as part of the project. (10pt)
  * **Demonstration of Project (15 points total)**
    * Video recording is a minimum of 3-5 minutes in length, but may be longer. (5pt)
    * Student verbally describes how to start and use the application. (5pt)
    * Student discusses the testing process as part of the project and the verbal description matches the written description. (5pt)
* **Student Grading Rubric (75pt)**
  * Video Processing and Functionality (60 pt)
    * Video Feed is displayed (25pt)
    * Video runs above 30 fps (5pt)
    * Categories mentioned are displayed when they encounter the object they're supposed to detect (15pt)
    * If there is nothing in the frame show that nothing is detected (15pt)
  * User Interaction (15 pt)
    * Takes user input for frame size, and confidence levels (15pt)  

Total Points: 200

### Additional Grading Notes

* Customers will not pay for programs that do not work, programs that do not run due to syntax errors will receive __0 Points__.
* Programmers tend to forget how large programs work over time, as a result up to __5 Points__ may be taken for programs that do not have a _reasonable_ amount of comments that describe key sections of code.
* All programs must have your Github URL submitted in Canvas via the assignment page. Unsubmitted Github repos will receive __0 Points__.
* Programs that have been submitted and received a grade will not be regraded, unless the instructor makes a request for changes.
* If a program is eligible for regrading, it is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor when the program is ready for regrading.
* Professional programmers are required to hit tough deadlines, late assignments will loose __20 Points__.
* While automated unit tests may be used, manual testing of your code is also required. 
* Review of the coding style will be used in grading. Up to __20 points__ may be taken if the code does not meet the instructions in the directions.
* Submitted code may be subject to inspection by the [Measure of Software Simularity (MOSS)](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) to check for simularity in programs that may be related to plagerism. It is up to the instructor to determine if plagarism is occuring.
* Programmers need to treat any logins or API keys as confidential information that should never be published to GitHub. Confidential information published to GitHub will loose __5 Points__.
